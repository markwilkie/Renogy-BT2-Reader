sentence=A library that uses bluetooth to read data from Renogy DCC30S and DCC50S MPPT solar controllers that use a BT2 bluetooth dongle
paragraph=This library communicates with BT2 dongles attached to Renogy DCC30S and DCC50S controllers and can read any relevant registers with simple commands.   The library uses Adafruit nrf52 Feather series devices and can be adapted to other Arduino controllers, and should work with other Renogy devices if the register map is updated.   This library can also support multiple connections if more than one device is active
